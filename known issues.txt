ADmin menu - add new button


VESION 3.2
------------
admin bar on right howdy and logout rename not working
solution: check if 3.2 version or higher and do something different

login page-login top bar does not exist. if >3.2 change option text 'hide login top bar completely' to like 'remove go back to page'

admin menu - does not work

colorizer - widget background does not work

VESION 3.3.1
--------------------
//- admin vs other users distinguish check. (menu removal for other users does not work)
//- "Page Settings Admin Bar" with my logo,The new WP Admin Bar appears, however, and shows the logo of WP and its sub-menu with links that refer to the Wordpress site
-custom buttons arget box (new, parent, blank), 
-wp-login customisation, give the option to change the background colour
-change wp logo does not seem to change anything.
- meant to say that 'hide wp logo' works, but only with the Admin panel.
- it would be best if instead of 'hiding' this logo we could effectively 'replace' this logo, while 'hiding' only the help menu under it.
- admin menu remove on non admin pages
- what Remove Icons check box makes the actual links disappear.
