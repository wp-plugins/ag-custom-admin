== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Plugin does not work after upgrading to new version. What should I do? =
Try to clear browser's cache, and reload page. In extreme situations, you would need to remove plugin and to download and install fresh installation from WordPress repository.

= I see only blank page. What to do? =
This is caused by JavaScript error thrown by AGCA or some other plugin. If you want to deactivate plugin, but you can't access admin panel, turn off JavaScript in your browser and than log in back and deactivate plugin (This works only for administrator). Try also to clear browser's cache. If this does not work, try to find javaScript error in browser's console and post it to plugin's support page.

= Something is wrong with Admin Menu buttons =
Please use 'Reset Settings' button on Admin Menu page to reset menu configuration to defaults. Remember that you should postpone admin menu configuration to the very end of admin page customization, because, any changes made from other plugins to admin menu (e.g adding new button of plugin that is activated, or removing that button when plugin is deactivated) could corrupt admin menu configuration.

= Some errors appear on my page =
Go to browser's console and see if there are any errors. Try to locate them. If you can't fix error by yourself, post it back to plugin's support page.

= Plugin does not work =
Try clearing browser's cache. If that does not work, go to browser's console and see if there are any errors. Try to locate them. If you can't fix error by yourself, post it back to plugin's support page. When trying to locate the problem, the best way is to disable other plugins, because there could be a conflict with them. If there is a conflict with other plugin, it can be found by disabling one by one plugin, until the problem is solved.
